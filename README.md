## Development server

To run the project and test the full functionality we need to start the frontend and backend.

`npm start` or `ng serve` for the frontend in the port 4200. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`npm run backend` for the backend and consume the api in db.json file

## Important information

We can only login with the credentials that you will see in the login.

We use json-server to simulate a backend with endpoints.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Unit testing and Docs
