## Challenge Description

[Challenge Instructions](https://github.com/adoclicdotcom/prueba_angular_2)

## Development Server

To run the project and test the full functionality, we need to start both the frontend and backend.

- Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for the frontend on port 4200. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `npm run backend` to start the backend and consume the API in the db.json file.

## Important Information

We can only login with the credentials provided on the login page and running json-server to simulate api with backend.

We use json-server to simulate a backend with endpoints.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

## Unit Testing and Documentation

- Run `npm test` to run the unit tests

Most of the tests include comments explaining how to interpret the obtained results. They may not all be complete due to time constraints, but I will add them soon.
